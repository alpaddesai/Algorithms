# Algorithms

The project provides custom Algorithms. It focuses on the CAD software for pcb designs.  

“To interconnect a set of n pins , we can use the arrangement of n-1 wires, each connecting two pins” The one that uses the least amount of wire in terms of length is the most desirable”. Given an acyclic positive weighted undirected connected graph G = (V,E) where V = finite set of nodes or vertices with E edges find the most efficient MST algorithm in terms of CPU time and resources.  The options for the algorithms are Kruskal algorithm , Prim algorithm , Greedy algorithm for shorted path Dijkstra. The number of node degrees (# of edges incident on it) and connectivity will can be randomized.
